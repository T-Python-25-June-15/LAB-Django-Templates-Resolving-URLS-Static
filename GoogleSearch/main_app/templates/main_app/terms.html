    <h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2>
    <p>
      We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service reflect the way that Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What you can expect from us – how we provide and develop our services</li>
      <li>What we expect from you – rules for using our services</li>
      <li>Content in Google services – intellectual property rights of content (yours, Google’s, or others’)</li>
      <li>In case of problems or disagreements – legal rights and what to expect in case of violations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these terms, we also publish a <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Provider</h2>
    <p>
      Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:
      <br><br>
      <strong>Google LLC</strong><br>
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway<br>
      Mountain View, California 94043<br>
      USA
    </p>

    <h2>Age Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.
