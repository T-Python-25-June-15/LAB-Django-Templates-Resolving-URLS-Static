                    <h4>What’s covered in these terms</h4>
                    <h5>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google <a href="">services</a>, and what we expect from you.</h5>
                    <span>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
                        <li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
                        <li>Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or others</li>
                        <li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span>Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.</span>
                    <span>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.</span>
