        <h3>What’s covered in these terms</h3>

        <p><strong>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service</strong>,
        but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google <span class="link">services</span>, and what we expect from you.</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and
        <span class="link">certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</span>. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What you can expect from us</strong>, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
            <li><strong>What we expect from you</strong>, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
            <li><strong>Content in Google services</strong>, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or others</li>
            <li><strong>In case of problems or disagreements</strong>, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.</p>

        <p>Besides these terms, we also publish a <span class="link">Privacy Policy</span>. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can <span class="link">update, manage, export and delete your information</span>.</p>
