    <h1>Google Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective 5 January 2022</strong> | <a href="https://www.google.com/terms/archive?hl=en-SA&fg=1">Archived versions</a> | <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20220105/it7r24p9/google_terms_of_service_en-GB.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

    <h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2>
    <p>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services">services</a>
    and what we expect from you.
    </p>

    <p>
        These Terms of Service reflect
        <a href="https://about.google/intl/en-GB_SA/how-our-business-works">the way that Google’s business works</a>,
        the laws that apply to our company, and
        <a href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_GB">certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</a>.
        As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services.
        For example, these terms include the following topic headings:
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-what-you-expect">What you can expect from us</a>: which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-what-we-expect">What we expect from you</a>: which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-content">Content in Google services</a>: which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or others</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-problems">In case of problems or disagreements</a>: which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>
        Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.
        Besides these terms, we also publish a
        <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy?hl=en-SA&fg=1">Privacy Policy</a>.
        Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_GB">update, manage, export and delete your information</a>.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Terms</h2>
    
      <h3>Service provider</h3>
      <p>
        Google <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services">services</a> are provided by, and you’re contracting with:<br>
        <strong>Google LLC</strong><br>
        organised under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA<br>
        1600 Amphitheatre Parkway<br>

        USA
      </p>
    
      <h3>Age requirements</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re under the
        <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_GB">age required to manage your own Google Account</a>,
        you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services">services</a>,
        then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their
        <a href="https://www.google.com/terms/service-specific?hl=en-SA&fg=1">service-specific additional terms and policies</a>.
