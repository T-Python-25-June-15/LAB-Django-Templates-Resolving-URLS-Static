        <h2>What's covered in these terms</h2>

        <p><b>We know it's tempting to skip these Terms of Service,
        but it's important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google <a href="">services</a>,
        and what we expect from you.</b></p>

        <p>
            These Terms of Service reflect <a href="#">the way that Google's business works</a>,
            the laws that apply to our company, and
            <a href="#">certain things that we've always believed to be true</a>.
            As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google's relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="">What you can expect from us</a>, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
            <li><a href="">What we expect from you</a>, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
            <li><a href="">Content in Google services</a>, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or others</li>
            <li><a href="">In case of problems or disagreements</a>, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides these terms, we also publish a <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can <a href="">update</a>, <a href="">manage</a>, <a href="">export and delete your information.</a>
        </p>
