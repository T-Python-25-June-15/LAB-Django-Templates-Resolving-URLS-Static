    <h2>What’s covered in these terms</h2>
    <p>
      We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use
      <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services">Google services</a>, and what we expect from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service reflect
      <a href="https://about.google/intl/en-GB_SA/how-our-business-works">the way that Google’s business works</a>,
      the laws that apply to our company, and
      <a href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_GB">certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</a>.
      As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you.
